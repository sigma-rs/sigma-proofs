/// A trait defining the behavior of a generic Sigma protocol.
///
/// A Sigma protocol is a 3-message proof protocol where a prover can convince
/// a verifier of knowledge of a witness for a given public statement
/// without revealing the witness.
///
/// ## Associated Types
/// - `Commitment`: The prover's initial commitment.
/// - `ProverState`: The prover's internal state needed to compute a response.
/// - `Response`: The prover's response to a verifier's challenge.
/// - `Witness`: The prover's secret knowledge.
/// - `Challenge`: The verifier's challenge value.
///
///  ## Minimal Implementation
/// Types implementing [`SigmaProtocol`] must define:
/// - `prover_commit` — Generates a commitment and internal state.
/// - `prover_response` — Computes a response to a challenge.
/// - `verifier` — Verifies a full transcript `(commitment, challenge, response)`.
///
/// ## Serialization
/// Implementors must also provide methods for serialization and deserialization
/// of each component of the proof.
/// Required methods:
/// - `serialize_commitment` / `deserialize_commitment`
/// - `serialize_challenge` / `deserialize_challenge`
/// - `serialize_response` / `deserialize_response`
///
/// These functions should encode/decode each component into/from a compact binary format.
///
/// ## Identification
/// To allow transcript hash binding and protocol distinction,
/// implementors must provide:
/// - `protocol_identifier` — A fixed byte identifier of the protocol.
/// - `instance_label` — A label specific to the instance being proven.
